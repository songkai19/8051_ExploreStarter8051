 * Description: This file contains the program to demonstrate the LED blinking. 

The libraries have been tested on ExploreEmbedded development boards. We strongly believe that the
library works on any of development boards for respective controllers. However, ExploreEmbedded
disclaims any kind of hardware failure resulting out of usage of libraries, directly or indirectly.
